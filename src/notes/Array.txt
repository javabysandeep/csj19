What are we trying to achieve?
- We want to store multiple values.
    1. we can create that many variables manually.
        - code length increases
        - managing the variables is difficult
        - time-consuming process
        - performance issue.
    2. use the concept of array.

What is an array?
- What is it?
    - It is a group of elements which are of same type and stored sequentially.
- How to create ?
    - e.g. int[] array = new int[100]; // in this line we are creating 100 variables.
- Why do we need an array?
    - To store multiple elements of same type
- Advantage
    - Retrieval of data is faster
Disadvantage:
    - They are fixed in nature. We cannot modify the memory size at runtime.
    - We cannot hold heterogeneous data

- Array is an object created which holds the multiple values.
- Array elements are initialized with default value.
- We get the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExecption, we try to access index which is out of index boundaries
- We get NegativeArraySizeException, if we specify the array size in negative
- For every array, a variable is created called as "length" which tells the size of any array

int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};
array = new int[10];
